# University projects
The following is a list of the projects I have completed during the last three years of my studies at the university.

## Project List:
1. **Task Management App**
2. **Quoridor Game**
3. **Calculator**
4. **Hardening Project**
5. **Virtualization Project**
6. **Wind Pressure Zones**

### Task Management App
This application is written in C# using the .NET Framework. It utilizes a MySQL server for data management.

### Quoridor Game
Developed as a course project, this game was written in C#. The task involved not only creating the game itself but also programming an artificial intelligence (AI) to play the game.

### Calculator
This project is written in C++. The application can evaluate arithmetic expressions, such as "2 + 3 / 4 - (5 + 8 / 5)".

### Hardening Project
The purpose of this project was to write YAML scripts to harden a LAMP server, making it more secure. The project folder also contains a Bash script to prepare an "unsecure" virtual machine (VM).

### Virtualization Project
This project involved writing Bash scripts to create three virtual machines (VMs) using OpenNebula: a web server, a database server, and a client server. For each VM, a separate configuration script was developed.

### Wind Pressure Zones
This project was part of a larger initiative aimed at developing a program to calculate optimal solar panel placement on roofs based on wind pressure zones. The entire project, including my contribution, was written in Java.
